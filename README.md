# Election_Analysis

**1.	Overview of Election Audit:** 

  
  The purpose of this election audit was initially to help Seth and Tom to submit the election audit, but the commission requested additional information. In addition to the information displayed, the commission wanted to add; **the voter turnout for each county, percentage of the voters from each county from the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.**

**3.	Election-Audit Summary:**

For the commission, this analysis can be modified slightly to be adapted to any future election by providing the new data sets. One way the code can be modified is by instructing it to pull the information from that new file there for populatin the demographics displayed in the election_analysis.txt file found in the Analysis folder in this github. Another way, which is basically an extension of the first one, is that any infromation that is formated like an election can be added to this code and do minor modifications to populate the demographics.
